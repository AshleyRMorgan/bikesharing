## Results
### Checkout times

Based on the visualization, the vast majority of trips are 5 minutes. The longer the diration of the check out time, there are fewer riders who check out a bike for that duration of time. The majority of all check out durations are under an hour.

### Checkout times by Gender

This visualization is similar to the checkout times vizualization but it can be seen that males check out bikes far more frequently than females or unknown users. The average trip duration for males is 5 minutes. For felames the average trip duration is 6 minutes while unknown users have a trip duration of 10 minutes.

### Trips by Weekday for Each Hour

Based on the heatmap for visulizting weekday usage by hour, we can see that there is increased usage before and after working hours (8:00am-5:00pm) during the week. There is a decrease in afternoon useage on Wednesday afternoons when all other weekday afternoons have higher usage. On the weekends, usage is steady throughout the day.

 ### NYC Citi Bike Dashboard
 
 The cummulatize dashboard displays the average trip duration, top starting locations, number of riders and the gender of riders.
 The most interesting piece of this dashboard is the gender of riders composition. The number of male riders far exceeds unknown and female riders combined.

## Summary

In summary, the NYC Citi Bike program is used primarily by male users. There is high utilization of bikes during work commuting hours and steady use on the weekend.
NYC Citi Bike would benefit from marketing towards female and unknown riders to help increase the number of users.
The first additional vizualization I recommend would be a comparision between a summer month and a winter months.
The second additional vizualization I would recommend is a break down of the type of customers utilization bikes. This could be helpful to deterime the composition of customers between residents and tourists.
